generation of teacher now it be very difficult to say with conviction that there be no black sheep in the teach flock of the past it may be argue that their dishonourable activity pass off without much uproar a press and electronic medium be not so active take for example the case of corporal punishment it be commonly believe that the teacher s beating be well intentioned but today s teacher must realise that not only the circumstance but the law have also undergone transformation he must spare no effort to befit himself in the change environment and equip himself with the new technique to play his role positively another point deserves careful examination in the two tier system of education government school and convent public school a wide gulf have occur college teacher with government school background confront student passing out from convent school face several problem include those of pronunciation and expression the situation becomes awkward when the teacher turn out to be incompetent and his student have wider academic knowledge than him there be example where some brilliant student could not score the expect mark in examination perhaps because their answer happen to be beyond the comprehension and range of the examiner the remedy lie in hold occasional in service training camp orientation refresher course and other similar academic exercise for the teacher it would surely be incorrect to claim that the ancient guru or past teacher have superior academic standard accord to shaw s theory of life force every new generation be wiser more active more intelligent than the previous one how can therefore the teacher of the new generation alone be inferior the moot point be the environment perhaps the society itself be partly responsible for the

              " 'scientist have modify human embryo to remove genetic mutation that cause heart failure in otherwise healthy young people in a landmark demonstration of the controversial procedure it be the first time that human embryo have have their genome edit outside china where researcher have perform a handful of small study to see whether the approach could prevent inherit disease from be pass on from one generation to the next while none of the research so far have create baby from modify embryo a move that would be illegal in many country the work represent a milestone in scientist effort to master the technique and brings the prospect of human clinical trial one step closer the work focus on an inherit form of heart disease but scientist believe the same approach could work for other condition cause by single gene mutation such a cystic fibrosis and certain kind of breast cancer this embryo gene correction method if proven safe can potentially be use to prevent transmission of genetic disease to future generation say paula amato a fertility specialist involve in the u korean study at oregon health and science university the scientist use a powerful gene edit tool call crispr ca to fix mutation in embryo make with the sperm of a man who inherit a heart condition know a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or hcm the disease which lead to a thicken of the heart s muscular wall affect one in people and be a common cause of sudden cardiac arrest in young people crispr or to give it it full name crispr ca allows scientist to precisely target and edit piece of the genome crispr be a guide molecule make of rna that allows a specific site of interest on the dna double helix to be target the rna molecule be attach to ca a bacterial enzyme that work a a pair of molecular scissors to cut the dna at the exact point require this allows scientist to cut paste and delete single letter of genetic code human have two copy of every gene but some disease be cause by a mutation in only one of the copy for the study the scientist recruit a man who carry a single mutant copy of a gene call mybpc which cause hcm when the scientist make embryo with the man s sperm and healthy egg from donor they found that a expect about half of the embryo carry the mutant gene if the affected embryo be implant into woman and carry to term the result child would inherit the heart condition write in the journal nature the researcher describe how gene edit dramatically reduce the number of embryo that carry the dangerous mutation when perform early enough at the same time a fertilisation out of embryo or be found to be free of the disease cause mutation the work have impressed other scientist in the field because in previous experiment gene edit have work only partially mend harmful mutation in some cell but not others another problem happens when the wrong gene be modify by mistake but in the late work the scientist found no evidence of these so call off target effect they ve get remarkably good result it s a big advance say richard hynes a geneticist at mit who this year co chair a major report on human genome edit for the u national academy of science na this brings it closer to clinic but there s still a lot of work to do today people who carry certain genetic disease can opt for ivf and have their embryo screen for harmful mutation the procedure can only help if there be a chance that some embryo will be healthy accord to shoukhrat mitalipov who lead the late research gene edit could bolster the number of healthy embryo available for doctor to implant more work be need to prove that gene edit would be safe to do in people but even if it seem safe scientist face major regulatory hurdle before clinical trial could start in the u congress have bar the food and drug administration from even consider human trial with edit embryo while in the uk it be illegal to implant genetically modify embryo in woman the procedure be controversial because genetic modification make to an embryo affect not only the child it becomes but future generation too it s still a long road ahead say mitalipov it s unclear when we d be allow to move on in the late study the mutation be correct by a route that scientist have not see before with the cell copying healthy dna from the mother s egg instead of the template one question scientist need to explore now be whether mutation carry by egg can be correct a easily a those carry by sperm if all of this hold up for different gene and be also true when the mutation be inherit from the mother it will be a major step forward say janet rossant senior scientist and chief of research emeritus at the hospital for sick child in toronto ask about the potential for gene edit to produce designer baby rossant a co author of the na report on gene edit say it be a distant prospect we be still a long way from serious consideration of use gene edit to enhance trait in baby she say we don t understand the genetic basis of many of the human trait that might be target for enhancement even if we do a genetic alteration that enhance one trait could have unexpected negative consequence on other trait and this would

in the study state the paris accord sign by country commits to hold the average global temperature to well below c above pre industrial level and set a more aspirational goal to limit warm to c this latter target be barely plausible the new research find with just a chance that temperature will rise by less than c we re closer to the margin than we think say adrian raftery a university of washington academic who lead the research publish in nature climate change if we want to avoid c we have very little time left the public should be very concerned government settle on the c threshold

emission scenario the researcher found that carbon intensity will be a crucial factor in future warm technological advance be expect to cut global carbon intensity by over the course of the century

to about billion people by but the research found that this will have a relatively small impact upon temperature a much of this growth will take place in sub saharan africa which be a minor contributor of greenhouse gas emission it have long be acknowledge that emission cut promise under the the paris agreement would not be sufficient to avoid c warm however it be hop that periodic review of commitment will result in more severe reduction donald trump s pledge to remove the u the world s second large emitter from the accord have cast a large shadow over these ambition even if the c target isn t met action be very important say raftery the more the temperature increase the bad the impact will be we would warn against any tendency to use our result to say that we won t avoid c and so it s too late to do anything on the contrary avoid the high temperature increase that our model envisages be even more important and also require urgent action raftery acknowledge that a breakthrough technology could dramatically change the outlook but note that major advance of the past year such a the computer robotics hybrid car the internet and electronic fuel injection have improve carbon efficiency steadily at around a year rather than in huge jump andrew dessler a climate scientist at texas a m university who be not involve in the study say the research s conclusion be reasonable but say it be difficult to assign a precise probability to future temperature rise i agree that stay below c and c be unlikely and very very unlikely respectively he say but this research give a false sense of rigor tomorrow someone could invent a carbon free energy source that everyone adopts if you look at technology adoption and action take on the ozone layer and acid rain it s clear these thing can change faster than people predict dessler say the fall cost of renewable energy would be a major factor in reduce emission but far impetus would be need through new action such a

the country this google railtel initiative be launch in january and till date have reach station across india their lofty aim be to reach station by under this initiative railtel a subsidiary of the government of india provide the high speed network via fiber while google set up the wireless infrastructure and provide tech support the speed on offer range from mbps for minute after which they be gradually reduce in order to manage bandwidth the india today tech have the opportunity to experience google s railtel initiative first hand at nizamuddin railway station we also interviewed gulzar azad head of connectivity google india who spoke about the partnership with railtel the challenge face in bring high speed wi fi to of india s major railway station what google and railtel have learnt along the way and the road ahead for this ambitious initiative q this initiative start before jio revolutionise the telecom sector with it disruptive plan and brought g to the mass have you see a dip in the daily usage since jio enter the marketplace have the widespread and cheap availability of g data since the entry of jio affected google s railtel strategy in any way this be a great question very relevant in today s time what we have see be that a g have emerge we have see no dip in the wi fi usage if you talk about the time when free g start emerge we be at about million lakh monthly active user today we be at million lakh monthly active user so the railtel initiative have only grown since then the railway station be a great point of convergence at this point of convergence there be the need for multiple network and multiple system to satisfy the user demand before the advent of free g people be not even think of consume gb data a month let alone gb data a day the mark of telecommunication development of any country be how close the fiber be to the user in effect you must see that the wi fi that we be implement be an attempt to bring fiber close to the user and that be work pretty well for u q during my interaction with passenger and worker at the nizzamudin railway station i found out that many of them feel that during peak hour the speed slows down quite a bit be that something you be look into i feel that be also a very interest emerge phenomenon if you see when we start the project even at peak hour the speed we be give the user be very satisfactory and now people want more this be exactly what we be expect once people start experience high speed internet the user behavior change the expectation now be high there be more demand for less and less latency in the network the good news for u be that across the last twelve month we have not see a dip in monthly active user the average usage still remains mb per user per session which show we have augment the network and capacity while add more user a g have emerge we have see no dip in the wi fi usage if you talk about the time when free g start emerge we be at about million monthly active user today we be at million monthly active usersmr gulzar azad then spoke about how google be take step to make the railtel initiative financially viablesince april we have make the login process ad support and that be help railtel from an isp perspective the revenue be majorly meant for railtel we have a revenue share mechanism which be expect a we be a contributor to the project itself google help build the wireless infrastructure and railtel brings in the fibre and the connectivity q the railtel initiative be in the news a couple of month ago a it be found that it be be use for watch porn in many railway station be any measure put into place after that the idea of the internet here from an experience point of view be to make it the same internet that you and i have and for that internet to be available to everyone that be the singular goal of our vision for a billion people to experience the internet you and i experience in our home in our office and when we do that we be follow the regulation set by the country the isp railtel follow the regulation from the government in term of what s allow on the internet and what s not this internet be not different from every other internet across the country q if we talk about the speed i be told that mbps be the minimum speed even when the limit high speed cap be cross be that a realistic claim the way the network have be set up there be actually no speed limit before or after the design of the network be such that in the first minute time limit we allow the user to get unfettered access the idea be to get all user to a point where they could access high quality hd video stream after the time limit be cross we make sure that everybody do still have internet and the net be still low latency we be adjust the network dynamically so that people can still access the internet but in the first half an hour they can access hd quality video stream q but what be the minimum speed i spoke to many people and get a lot of vary reply some people say it be a bad a kbps but others say they can stream video for hour the quality of your internet be not just measure by the speed it be also measure by the latency of the network we have design the network in a way that even when the network be at low speed it be still a low latency network the internet be dynamically configure in such a way that you will still be able perform certain use case like opening a search page run apps like whatsapp and messenger after the high speed cap get over after minute this be a great advancement if you compare this with wi fi in london and san francisco you will find that the wi fi be well in both coverage and capacitynote the network be dynamically adjust in such a way that priority be give to those who be log in for the first time this be why the minute high speed cap exists during our time at the nizamuddin railway station we get average speed of mpbs download during the minute unfettered limit also we found out that all access point be already dual band ghz and ghz capable in order to cope with future demand q what be the business model that google and railtel be follow how be google benefiting from this project for google this be an ecosystem project our idea with this be to make sure there be more and more broadband adoption the more the adoption the more people come online and the great the economic impact when there be economic impact on digitisation we get directly impact because we be a stakeholder in the digitisation of the country also the more people use internet the more they use e commerce social network news website and eventually google service q at the nizamuddin railway station and the new delhi railway station which i visit a few week ago the advertising be quite minimal also a lot of people even in tier city like delhi and mumbai be unaware of this initiative so what be google and railtel s future plan regard awareness address awareness of wi fi be certainly an important issue and we need the help of the indian railway and the government to do that more and more a you can see the wi fi be already free so there be not much space for business to market on it but the indian railway who host this they should be partner with u to make more and more awareness happen there be various channel of awareness we have try audio announcement and visuals we have also try have agent at the station i think to raise awareness in a sustainable way we need help from the government',\n",

equally unforgiving on track in a battle that have swayed gloriously between them finally show their hand a to how that fight would proceed in the second half of the season sebastian vettel won what be hardly a classic race but lewis hamilton in stand by his team mate admit he might have drop point that could ultimately cost him the world championship vettel won at the hungaroring with an impressive drive from pole position that he do so while nursing a damage steer wheel make it all the more of an achievement but also put the scuderia on the spot his team mate kimi raikkonen be quicker on track but they chose not to order vettel to allow him to pas that the german be their only title contender could not have be clearer in their wake hamilton be on a charge and in turn faster than his team mate valtteri bottas with passing at the hungaroring all but impossible this year he ask mercedes to tell bottas to let him through to chase down the lead ferraris agree that he would give the place back should he fail to overtake them bottas let him through and unable to pas raikkonen and seven second up the road from his team mate hamilton duly give back the place on the final lap raikkonen held second with bottas in third and hamilton fourth the british driver now trail vettel by point in the world championship and cede the place cost him three with the title fight likely to go to the wire it might yet prove to have be the sportsmanlike gesture that could deny him a fourth driver title this year i want to win the championship the right way he say i don t know whether that will come back to bite me on the backside or not but i say at the begin of the year i want to win it the right way i do think today be the right way to do thing ferrari have a long history of impose team order and designate a no driver but the mercedes executive director toto wolff agree with hamilton and drew a stark comparison with how his team and the scuderia go race we have see the backlash from decision that be ruthless and cold blood and the effect that it have on the brand he say you could say screw it it still won them the championship who care they be in the history book but i do not think that be the right spin and if the purpose of u be here be to do the right thing and win in the right way sometimes do it the right way and stand by your value be tough and it be today believe me give the place back be no easy feat bottas be only just in front of the red bull of max verstappen and there be a real danger the manoeuvre could have cost hamilton two place the team have debate whether it should be do but be clear hamilton be not instruct to do so and that he be merely stick to his word it be very sportsmanlike behaviour say wolff who also acknowledge that it could cost hamilton the title these value won u six championship and it will make u win more championship in year to come it cost u three point and could cost u the championship and we be perfectly conscious of that but in term of how the driver and this team operates we stick to what we say and if the consequence be a much a lose the championship then we will take it there be little doubt that vettel deserve the point both he and raikkonen have a pace advantage in the early stage over mercedes but he reveal he be wrestling with his damage car from the off i felt there be something not right on the grid and for the formation lap the steer wheel be not straight he say then it get bad and towards the end of the stint it be more difficult we spoke on the radio about it and i be told to avoid the kerb but on this track you use them on every corner so you lose speed it be good that it be tricky to overtake here it felt like a very long race ferrari have not won the constructor championship since and have not take the driver title since raikkonen claimed it in their step forward to go head to head with mercedes this season give them a real opportunity to end the drought raikkonen might have be pass by hamilton which would have cost them constructor point but they opt to gamble on the british driver be unable to do so it paid off and they can consider their strategy a success but it indicate that they be willing to risk the team championship in favour of backing vettel for the title maurizio arrivabene ferrari s team principal praise raikkonen for be a true team player and sergio marchionne the ferrari chief executive admit the result have come a a relief it be a much need win he say the great thing be we earn it this be a tough tough race and we almost lose it and we get it back vettel hold the lead go into the summer break and he have earn it but hamilton can also rest easy know that he held an honourable line in hungary the team be in a difficult position but i think

a year old male ask policeman to consider the futility of include them in the government order drive indu sarkar soon move to the central character indu kriti an orphan who want to become a poet but be told she must only dream to become a good wife and make a family follow the advice she marries navin sarkar tota roy chowdhury who dream of money power and fame while indu s dream be only to be a good wife for almost half of the fiim indu sarkar remains the story of a docile humble and meek orphan who surrender to every whim and fancy of her husband even a she fight her own stammer and a lack of confidence how this rather homely woman stumble upon victim of a police raid in a slum decides to fight for them and eventually becomes one of the most powerful voice of dissent during the emergency form the rest of the narrative neil nitin mukesh in a still from the film while the film be publicise a a film on emergency it actually oscillates between a political drama and a typical bollywood film about a couple unfortunately the transition between the two narrative be neither smooth nor convincing one of the saddest moment in the movie come when indu after she have left her husband s house for the sake of a couple of lose orphan kid decides to sign the divorce paper navin sends when ask why she agree for the divorce she say saath reh kar acchi biwi nahi ban payi ho sakta hai alag ho kar sukh de paun i could not be a good wife maybe i can give him some comfort by stay away a if all the protest and fight for freedom from a dictatorial government be nothing but a tool to pacify the husband the background score of indu sarkar be too loud and misplace at time when a rather emotional moment be approach what you hear be the loud melodramatic sound usually use in bollywood suspense drama anupam kher in a in a still from the film despite have gather a group of critically appreciate actor madhur bhandarkar fails to make the best use of them neil nitin mukesh be one of the most waste talent in the movie he have give some of his best performance a a mean high on power person but his act a chief in indu sarkar appear too superficial anupam kher and kriti kulhari take the lead in act department and stay true to their character for most of the part the support cast include sheeba chaddha ankur vikal and zakir hussain among others appear genuine in their role neil nitin mukesh in a still from the film however the over dramatic tone of the film kill their performance and leaf u with dialogue like ek goli ne mere jawan foot ke bete ko inch ki tasveer bana diya try to find logic in indu sarkar often becomes a task for example why do indu keep roam around in a rickshaw auto in the turkman gate area every time she need to witness an eye opener about the emergency when she be otherwise driven around in her husband s car or for that matter why do the protester lead by anupam kher a nanaji keep name each other when they meet inside a cinema hall to avoid get caught by the cop isn t the entire purpose of disguise defeat if they use the real name what be the reason do you ask well bollywood be the only word that come to our mind kriti kulhari in a still from the film for those interested in the politics of film there be two way to look at madhur bhandarkar s indu sarkar one be to look it a a propaganda film against the congress party aim at showcasing the atrocity inflict upon various community during the emergency there be a subtle yet extremely clear attempt to highlight muslim form a major portion of the victim we have neil nitin mukesh channel sanjay gandhi a the prime minister s son who be only refer to a the chief while the pm be refer to a mummyji the unofficial ban on kishore kumar from radio and television after he refuse to sing for sanjay gandhi also get a mention in the film on the other hand you can see indu sarkar a a double edge sword while it depicts the emergency and the gandhi family a the perpetrator of cruelty and injustice inflict upon the mass the film actually show the misuse of power if madhur bhandarkar want to patronise the ruling party the irony of his own film be lose on him the irony of indu sarkar be that it be so indulgent in highlight the importance of free speech and democracy that you could change a few name few other situation and it could well have be a film about the crisis india be face today people with allegiance to the ruling party exploit the mass and even politician at their own will so in the sheer hope that madhur actually aim for the latter political purpose two
